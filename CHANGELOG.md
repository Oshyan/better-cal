# Changelog

Better-Cal uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). While it is below 1.0, the minor number moves for new features or anything that changes how an existing install behaves, and the patch number for fixes, including security fixes. Every release is a git tag (`v0.1.1`) and a GitHub release; the running version is the `VERSION` file at the repository root, which the Settings page shows. Database migrations always run forward on deploy, so updating is: pull the tag, deploy.

Security fixes are tracked privately as GitHub security advisories until they ship; each advisory names the affected and patched versions.

## 0.1.4 (2026-09-23)

Security fixes from the 2026-09-23 scan (sign-in hardening).

- A sign-in attempt is counted before the password is checked, so a burst of simultaneous guesses can no longer slip past the limit. Successful sign-ins still never count against it.
- An unknown email address now takes exactly as long to reject as a known one, so response times no longer reveal which addresses have accounts, on the login form or CalDAV.
- The overall sign-in brake (which refuses new devices during a wide attack) now needs failures from at least six different addresses, so one or two attackers cannot shut out your new devices.
- `seed.php` asks for the password with echo off, or reads `BETTERCAL_SEED_PASSWORD`; `--password=` still works but warns, since it is visible to other users and stays in shell history.

## 0.1.3 (2026-09-23)

Security fixes from the 2026-09-23 scan.

- An event UID with unusual characters (a "/" in particular) no longer breaks CalDAV sync for its whole calendar. Ordinary UIDs keep their object names; unusual ones are named by an encoded form. A CalDAV client may re-download a calendar that held such an event once.
- A subscribed feed is checked for size before it is parsed, like an import: one with more events than the server can hold in memory (20,000 by default, `BETTERCAL_LIMIT_FEED_EVENTS`) is refused with a clear poll error instead of crashing the background worker.
- Incoming email HTML is scanned for script, style and embedded event markup in linear time, so a crafted message can no longer hold up mail processing.

## 0.1.2 (2026-09-23)

Security fixes from the 2026-09-23 scan. Updating is recommended for every install.

- Revoking access now revokes everything. A password reset removes every device registered for push reminders (your own browsers register again when you sign in), and the compromise reset (`seed.php --revoke-tokens`) also gives every outbound feed a new address and clears a reminder email address that is not the account's.
- An API token can no longer create or read outbound feed addresses, register a push device, or change where reminders go; those need you signed in with your password.
- New in Settings, Notifications: the list of every device reminders go to, with the one you are on marked, and Remove for any you do not recognise. New devices, removed devices, new outbound feeds and a changed reminder address are written to Activity.
- Operators: the deploy leaves the app's `.env` readable but not writable by the web app, and the dev-instance clone no longer puts the MySQL root password on a command line, takes its database user from `scripts/deploy.env` (new `DB_USER` setting), and strips sessions, tokens, push devices, feeds and Google links from the copy.

## 0.1.1 (2026-09-23)

Security fixes from the 2026-09-23 scan (advisories to be published once all related fixes ship):

- A successful sign-in or CalDAV request no longer resets the source's failed-password count; failures expire with the rate-limit window.
- A repeat rule with an out-of-range interval or count, from a feed, import, CalDAV, mail or Google, is dropped where it comes in, and a single event that cannot be expanded no longer fails the whole calendar.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-23)

Baseline: the first tagged version, covering everything built from July to September 2026 (see `FEATURES.md`). Earlier commits are unversioned.
