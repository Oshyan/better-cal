# Changelog

Better-Cal uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). While it is below 1.0, the minor number moves for new features or anything that changes how an existing install behaves, and the patch number for fixes, including security fixes. Every release is a git tag (`v0.1.1`) and a GitHub release; the running version is the `VERSION` file at the repository root, which the Settings page shows. Database migrations always run forward on deploy, so updating is: pull the tag, deploy.

Security fixes are tracked privately as GitHub security advisories until they ship; each advisory names the affected and patched versions.

## 0.1.1 (2026-09-23)

Security fixes from the 2026-09-23 scan (advisories to be published once all related fixes ship):

- A successful sign-in or CalDAV request no longer resets the source's failed-password count; failures expire with the rate-limit window.
- A repeat rule with an out-of-range interval or count, from a feed, import, CalDAV, mail or Google, is dropped where it comes in, and a single event that cannot be expanded no longer fails the whole calendar.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-23)

Baseline: the first tagged version, covering everything built from July to September 2026 (see `FEATURES.md`). Earlier commits are unversioned.
